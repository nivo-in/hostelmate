## 🎯 Overview

Every hostel in India manages **500+ students** using register books, WhatsApp groups, and verbal complaints. HostelMate digitizes this entirely.

### The Problem

| Traditional Process | Pain Point |
|---|---|
| Paper attendance registers | Proxy attendance, no analytics |
| WhatsApp complaint groups | Messages get buried, no tracking |
| Verbal leave requests | No audit trail, parents uninformed |
| Printed mess menus | Outdated, no feedback mechanism |
| Notice boards | Students miss critical updates |

### The Solution

HostelMate provides a **role-based platform** where students, wardens, and parents each get purpose-built interfaces. Attendance uses **rotating QR codes + GPS geofencing** to eliminate proxy. Complaints flow through a **ticketing system** with urgency flags. Parents get **real-time visibility** into their child's hostel activity.

## ⚡ Engineering Highlights

### 1. Rotating QR Codes — Eliminating Screenshot Fraud

Students sharing QR screenshots is the #1 proxy attendance method. HostelMate generates QR codes that **rotate every 30 seconds** with embedded timestamps.

```
QR Payload: {
  "date": "2026-05-08",
  "token": "2026-05-08-secret123-1715150400"  // date + secret + epoch
}
```

**Validation logic:** The server verifies both `parsedQr.date === today` AND `parsedQr.token.startsWith(today-secret)`. A screenshot taken at 9:00 AM is invalid by 9:00:30 AM.

### 2. Haversine Geofencing — Location-Based Enforcement

Even with valid QR codes, students could scan from outside campus. HostelMate enforces a **100-meter radius** using the Haversine formula:

```
a = sin²(Δφ/2) + cos(φ₁) · cos(φ₂) · sin²(Δλ/2)
c = 2 · atan2(√a, √(1−a))
d = R · c        // R = 6,371,000 meters
```

The API returns the exact distance if rejected: *"You are 342m away from hostel. Must be within 100m."*

### 3. Redis Caching with Smart Invalidation

Not all data is equal. HostelMate uses **tiered TTL caching** based on data volatility:

| Cache Key | TTL | Invalidated By |
|---|---|---|
| `mess:menu` | 1 hour | Menu update |
| `stats:dashboard` | 3 min | Any data mutation |
| `attendance:stats:today` | 5 min | New attendance mark |
| `attendance:today:{date}` | 2 min | New attendance mark |
| `notices:{role}` | 3 min | New notice posted |
| `mess:reviews` | 5 min | New review submitted |

Every write operation triggers **targeted cache invalidation** — never stale data, never unnecessary DB hits.

### 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Every route is gated by middleware that verifies JWT → fetches user profile → checks role:

```
Request → authenticate() → requireWarden() → validate(schema) → handler
```

Three roles with strict separation: **Student**, **Warden**, **Parent**. A student cannot access warden analytics. A parent cannot submit complaints. Enforced at the middleware layer, not the frontend.

### 5. Zod Schema Validation

Every request body is validated against a Zod schema before reaching the handler. Invalid requests get structured error responses:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "details": [
    { "field": "reason", "message": "Reason must be at least 20 characters" }
  ]
}
```

### 6. Smart Lost & Found Auto-Matching

When a student reports a lost or found item, the system automatically scans existing reports with the opposite status using Jaccard similarity on extracted keywords. If similarity score > 25%, both parties receive an instant notification.

```
Student A: "Lost black leather wallet near Block A"
Student B: "Found black wallet near canteen"
Keywords A: [black, leather, wallet, block]
Keywords B: [black, wallet, canteen]
Jaccard Score: 2/5 = 0.40 → 40% match → NOTIFY BOTH
```

### 7. GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

Two workflows run on every push:

**`ci.yml`** — triggers on push to `v2` and `main`, and on PRs to `main`:

| Step | Command | What it guards |
|---|---|---|
| Lint client | `cd apps/client && pnpm lint` | ESLint (Next.js Core Web Vitals + TypeScript rules) |
| Build client | `cd apps/client && pnpm build` | Next.js production build with injected secrets |
| Check server | `node --check src/index.js` | Syntax validity of the ES Module server |
| Server tests | `cd apps/server && pnpm test` | All 20 Jest suites with mocked Supabase/Redis |
| Security audit | `pnpm audit --audit-level moderate` | Dependency vulnerability scan |

**`docker-build.yml`** — triggers on push to `main` only:

- Builds `hostelmate-server:latest` and `hostelmate-client:latest` using Docker Buildx
- Uses GitHub Actions layer cache (`type=gha`) for fast rebuilds
- Runs with `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true` to suppress Node.js 22 deprecation warnings

Pipeline completes in **~55 seconds**. No broken code reaches `main`.

### 8. Face Recognition with Anti-Spoofing Liveness Detection

HostelMate uses **client-side biometric verification** powered by `face-api.js` (SsdMobilenetv1 + 68-point landmarks). Registration captures **5 angles** (straight, left, right, up, down) — 24 frames total, averaged into 5 per-angle descriptors stored in Supabase.

**Verification runs three hard gates before accepting a match:**

| Gate | Check | How it blocks spoofing |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — Blink (mandatory)** | Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) falling-edge detection using 68-point landmarks. EAR = `(‖p2−p6‖ + ‖p3−p5‖) / (2 × ‖p1−p4‖)`. EAR < 0.25 on a falling edge = blink confirmed. | A static photo on a phone screen **cannot blink** — no real eye movement, no EAR drop. |
| **2 — Frame-diff (hard-block)** | A 32×32 patch of the face region is sampled every tick, compared pixel-by-pixel (grayscale) to the previous frame. Avg diff < 6/255 over 10+ frames = static source. | Catches a photo held still after a fake EAR dip (e.g., tilting the phone). |
| **3 — Face match** | Euclidean distance vs all 5 stored angle descriptors. Best (minimum) distance must be < 0.52. | Threshold set below face-api's default 0.6 — tight enough to reject strangers, loose enough to match front-facing without head rotation. |

**Performance:** Recursive async tick instead of `setInterval` — next detection fires 50ms after the previous completes (~3× more detections/sec). Blink → verified in **~300ms total**. EMA smoothing on the confidence bar prevents jitter.

### 9. AI Complaint Classification & Predictive Maintenance

HostelMate integrates **Groq's blazing-fast inference API** (using `llama-3.1-8b-instant`) to instantly process maintenance requests. 

When a student submits a complaint, the AI automatically:
1. **Categorizes** the issue (e.g., plumbing, electrical).
2. **Flags Urgency** based on safety risks (e.g., "sparking fan" = urgent).
3. **Generates a Warden Summary** with specific resolution steps.

Additionally, a **Predictive Maintenance Dashboard** analyzes the last 30 days of complaints to identify recurring patterns (e.g., "Block A lights flicker frequently") and suggests preventive measures, saving time and money.

### 10. Razorpay Payment Integration

Full fee lifecycle management backed by HMAC-SHA256 payment verification:

```
Warden creates fee structure → generates bills for all students → students/parents pay online
→ Razorpay order created → payment captured → HMAC-SHA256 signature verified → status: paid
→ receipt generated → student + parent notified
```

| Endpoint | Role | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/payments/generate-bills` | Warden | Bulk-generate fee bills for a period |
| `POST /api/payments/create-order` | Student/Parent | Create Razorpay order for a pending bill |
| `POST /api/payments/verify` | Student/Parent | Verify HMAC signature, mark paid, notify |
| `POST /api/payments/cancel` | Student/Parent | Reset stuck `processing` payments to `pending` |
| `PATCH /api/payments/:id/mark-paid` | Warden | Record cash/offline payment |
| `POST /api/payments/send-reminders` | Warden | Notify all students with dues within 3 days |

Parents can pay on behalf of their ward — the API resolves the `parent → student` link automatically.

### 11. Visitor Management System

Digital guest check-in with full lifecycle tracking and warden approval gate:

```
Student registers visitor → wardens notified → warden approves/rejects
→ student notified → visitor arrives → warden checks in → visitor checks out
```

Status flow: `pending → approved / rejected → checked_in → checked_out`

All visitor records include `visitor_name`, `visitor_phone`, `purpose`, `relationship`, and `expected_visit_date`.

### 12. Husky Pre-Commit Hooks

Every `git commit` is gated by two automated checks that run **before the commit is created**:

```bash
# .husky/pre-commit
cd apps/client && pnpm lint    # ESLint — blocks on warnings/errors
cd apps/server && pnpm test    # Jest   — blocks on any test failure
```

This ensures **zero broken code is ever committed**, closing the gap between local development and CI. The hooks are installed automatically on `pnpm install` via the `prepare: husky` lifecycle script.

### 13. End-to-End Testing with Playwright

Browser-level E2E tests live in `apps/client/e2e/` and are configured in `playwright.config.ts`:

| Config | Value |
|---|---|
| Test runner | Playwright (`@playwright/test` ^1.60) |
| Browser | Chromium (Desktop Chrome) |
| Base URL | `http://localhost:3000` |
| Retries on CI | 2 |
| Workers on CI | 1 (serial, stable) |
| Trace | On first retry |
| Reporter | HTML |

The config **auto-starts both dev servers** (`client` on :3000, `server` on :3001) before the suite runs — no manual setup needed:

```bash
# Run E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Open Playwright UI (interactive, with time-travel debugging)
pnpm test:e2e-ui
```

The suite covers **59 tests across 5 Playwright projects** (setup · login · student · warden · parent):

| Project | Spec file | Tests | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| `setup` | `auth.setup.ts` | 7 | Login UI structure + per-role auth state generation |
| `login` | `login.spec.ts` | 9 | Title, inputs, password toggle, loading state, redirect |
| `student` | `student.spec.ts` | 13 | All 10 student pages + leave form validation + urgent toggle |
| `warden` | `warden.spec.ts` | 16 | All 13 warden pages + notice form + visitor/fee content checks |
| `parent` | `parent.spec.ts` | 9 | All 6 parent pages + leave/track content checks |

Each role project uses **saved auth storage state** from the setup project — login is performed once, not before every test.

## 🔒 Security

| Layer | Implementation | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Authentication** | Supabase Auth + JWT | Every API request verified via `authenticate()` middleware |
| **Authorization** | RBAC Middleware | `requireStudent()`, `requireWarden()`, `requireStaff()` |
| **Row Level Security** | Supabase RLS Policies | Database-level access control on all tables |
| **Rate Limiting** | express-rate-limit | General: 100 req/15min · Auth: 10 req/15min · Notifications: 30 req/2min |
| **HTTP Hardening** | Helmet | Secure HTTP headers: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type |
| **Geofencing** | Haversine Formula | 100m radius — prevents remote proxy attendance |
| **Input Validation** | Zod v4 Schemas | Type-safe validation on every POST/PUT/PATCH |
| **QR Anti-Fraud** | Rotating Tokens | 30-second rotation prevents screenshot sharing |
| **Payment Security** | HMAC-SHA256 | Razorpay signature verified server-side before marking paid |
| **Biometric Anti-Spoofing** | EAR + Frame-diff | 3-gate liveness: mandatory blink + frame-diff + face match |
| **Pre-commit Gate** | Husky | ESLint + Jest must pass before any commit is created |
| **Error Handling** | Global Handler | Stack traces never exposed in production responses |
| **Audit Trail** | Winston + DB | Every warden action logged with timestamp, resource, and actor |
| **CI/CD Gates** | GitHub Actions | Every push linted, built, tested, and security-audited |

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please follow the standard process:

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** your feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. **Commit** your changes: `git commit -m 'feat: add amazing feature'`
4. **Push** to the branch: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
5. **Open** a Pull Request

### Commit Convention

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat:     New feature
fix:      Bug fix
docs:     Documentation
refactor: Code restructuring
test:     Adding tests
chore:    Maintenance tasks
perf:     Performance improvement
ci:       CI/CD configuration changes
```

### Pre-commit Checks

When you commit, Husky automatically runs:

1. **ESLint** on `apps/client` — enforces Next.js Core Web Vitals + TypeScript rules
2. **Jest** on `apps/server` — all 20 integration test suites must pass

If either check fails, the commit is **blocked**. Fix the errors, then commit again.

```bash
# Bypass hooks in an emergency (not recommended)
git commit --no-verify -m "chore: emergency fix"
```

### Running the Test Suite Locally

```bash
# Backend integration tests
cd apps/server && pnpm test

# Backend with coverage report
cd apps/server && pnpm test:coverage

# Frontend E2E tests (Playwright)
cd apps/client && pnpm test:e2e

# Frontend E2E with interactive UI
cd apps/client && pnpm test:e2e-ui
```
